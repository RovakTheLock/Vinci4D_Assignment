# Vinci4D CFD Solver Configuration File
# =====================================
# This YAML file configures the mesh, simulation parameters, and solver settings
# for the Vinci4D finite volume CFD solver.
#
# Mesh Configuration:
#   - Define domain geometry and discretization
#   - Controls grid resolution (total cells = num_cells_x * num_cells_y)
#
# Simulation Configuration:
#   - Physics parameters (Reynolds number, CFL)
#   - Time stepping and convergence criteria
#   - Output settings and tolerances
#
# Notes:
#   - Time step is automatically computed from CFL number
#   - Smaller CFL -> smaller time step -> more stable but slower
#   - Output directory will be created if it doesn't exist
#   - Convergence tolerances are checked during nonlinear iterations

mesh_parameters:
  x_range: [0, 1]
  y_range: [0, 1]
  num_cells_x: 250
  num_cells_y: 250

simulation:
  # Reynolds number (Re = rho * U * L / mu)
  # Higher Re -> more convection-dominated, less diffusion
  Re: 10000
  
  # Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy number (0 < CFL < 1 for stability)
  # dt = CFL * min(dx, dy) / max_velocity
  CFL: 0.8
  
  # Total simulation time to run (seconds)
  termination_time: 0.004
  
  # Nonlinear iterations per time step (momentum-pressure coupling)
  num_nonlinear_iterations: 5
  
  # Output frequency and directory
  output_frequency: 50              # Save results every N time steps
  output_directory: ./testing_output  # Directory to save VTK/data files
  
  # Convergence tolerances for nonlinear iterations
  continuity_tolerance: 1.0e-5       # Pressure equation (mass conservation)
  momentum_tolerance: 1.0e-5         # Momentum equation
